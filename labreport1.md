# **Lab Report 1**
We learned 3 terminal commands in the first week of CSE 15L. These are cd, ls and cat, which stand for "change directory", "list" and "concatenate".

I will cover 3 examples of using each Unix command.

Using cd with no arguments changes to the home directory.
Command: cd

The output after I run cd is just /home, which is the home directory. This is because running cd will always switch back to home directory, regardless of the current directory. This output is correct as running cd with no directory after should return to home.
Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.
So that’s 9 total examples (3 for each command). For each, include:

A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
What the working directory was when the command was run
A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it’s an error, explain why it’s an error.
You will upload your submission by publishing the page on Github Pages, then printing the page to PDF and uploading to the Lab Report 1 assignment on Gradescope.

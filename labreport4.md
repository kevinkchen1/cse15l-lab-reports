**Keys Pressed:** *`Ctrl-C: git@github.com:kevinkchen1/cse15llab7.git` `git clone` `Ctrl-V` `<Enter>`*
I used `Ctrl-C` to copy the ssh clone URL from my forked lab7 Github repository and then `Ctrl-V` to paste it into the command line after `git clone`. Then I pressed enter to run the completed command to clone the forked repository.

Commands:
1. `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar`

**Keys Pressed:** *`<up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <Enter>`* The `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar` command was used 5 commands ago so I pressed the up arrow 5 times to get to that command and then ran it.

2. `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests`
   
**Keys Pressed:** *`<up> <up> <up> <up><up> <Enter>`* Similarily, after running the previous command to compile the JUnit Test, the `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` was used 5 commands ago, so once again I pressed the up arrow 5 times to get to that command and than ran it to run the ListExamplesTests.

Kevin: pressed the arrow key down about 50 times to reach the line with bug, moved the cursor to the right at the end of “index1”. pressed i to enter insert mode, backspace once, then typed “2”, to change the variable name. Press esc to return to normal mode and :wq to save changes
Faster way to do it: from top of the file, 329w, e, x, i, enter “2”, esc. :wq
